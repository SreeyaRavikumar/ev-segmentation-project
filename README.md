# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation Analysis – India 🇮🇳⚡🚗

This project aims to analyze the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India using customer and vehicle-level segmentation. Using real-world government and survey data, we performed clustering, visualizations, and Fermi estimations to understand adoption readiness and vehicle demand.

## 📌 Objectives

- Segment Indian customers based on their **Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)** toward EVs
- Analyze EV adoption across vehicle types (2W, 3W, 4W)
- Support segmentation with **Fermi Estimation**
- Recommend **target segments** for EV product entry

## 📈 Key Techniques

- K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Fermi Estimation for market sizing
- Demographic analysis (Age, Gender, Income)

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Identified 3 key customer segments based on KAP scores
- Most adoption-ready segment: **Cluster 1** (~30% of target population)
- High demand predicted in **Uttar Pradesh**, **Delhi**, and **Bihar** for 3-wheelers
- Estimated total market: **~15 million likely EV adopters**
